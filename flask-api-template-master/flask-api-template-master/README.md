# flask-api-template
Backend Flask API template using Postgres

This README describes how to setup the environment and run the flask server

Based on the template found here https://github.com/spchuang/DoubleDibz-tutorial/tree/master/FINAL

## Installing Dependencies
This has been developed using python 3.6. You are recommended to use Anaconda or virtualenv to hold the dependencies to not pollute the system installs.

To install all packages and clean up the directory afterwards do
```
python setup.py install
python setup.py clean
```

## Environment Variables
This template uses environment variables to store the SECRET_KEY value, DATABASE_URL, and TEST_DATABASE_URL. So make sure you create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate those values, you can see them being used in the `app/config.py` file.
